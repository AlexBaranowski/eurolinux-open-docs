# EuroLinux 8 Jump Start

This document contains the necessary information to set up your first EuroLinux 8
installation. 

## System Requirements

### x86_64 (64 bit AMD/INTEL architecture)

Minimal and recommended requirements are following:

| Resource | Absolute minimal requirements for cloud deployment |  Minimal |  Recommended |
|----------|--------|------|---|
| Logical CPU | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| RAM  | 768MB or 512MB with swap space|  1 GB  | 1.5 GB per logical CPU |
| Storage | 5 GB (excluding swap)| 10GB | 20GB |


Logical CPU means Physical CPU (including Hyper-Threading) or vCPU (virtual
CPU). 

!!! warning
    It might be impossible to install EuroLinux on a system that does not meet
    recommended requirements.


#### About absolute minimums for cloud deployment

During our internal testing, we were able to boot and use very basic and already
installed services on Virtual Machine with only 256 MB of RAM however, without
additional memory or at least swap space available things like updating system
will result in actions of Kernel Out of Memory (OOM) Killer.


You can try it yourself with [EuroLinux Vagrant
boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/eurolinux-vagrant) and following Vagrantfile:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "eurolinux-vagrant/eurolinux-8"

  # Explicitly disable vbguest because we are using rsync
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-vbguest")
      config.vbguest.auto_update = false
  end

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "256"
    vb.cpus = 1
  end
  config.vm.provider "libvirt" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "256"
    vb.cpus = 1
  end
end
```

It's also possible to install EuroLinux on less than 5 GB of space, but it also
require extra attention.

All absolute minimums for cloud deployments described above are not officially
supported by EuroLinux.

### Secure boot

At the moment, EuroLinux does not support secure boot. The full secure boot
support is planned at the end of Q3/beginning of Q4.

## How to install EuroLinux 8 from ISO

### Where you can obtain ISO?

We distribute EuroLinux in a responsible open core model. Because of that, you
might download EuroLinux from different sources. The two primary sources are:

- [https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/isos/](https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/isos/)
  open for everyone
- [https://customerportal.euro-linux.com](https://customerportal.euro-linux.com)
  for EuroLinux customers

The only difference is that Customer Portal keep older versions when CDN that
is used for mirroring, keep only two latest ISO for each version to save
space (single EuroLinux AppStream isos might take up to 10 GB).


Lastly, if you are running a huge deployment - you might consider setup your
own mirror and download ISOs from Intranet.

### How to check ISO integrity

During download, many things can happen - from a network or sending host
failure to single-bit error. To check if ISO is undamaged, there are
two mechanisms in place. The first one allows you to check integrity without running
ISO. For each ISO available for the EuroLinux distro, there is a file that has
checksums saved. Filename says which algorithm was used to calculate
the cryptographic digest. For example, you can browse
https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/isos/ and read the `sha1sums.txt` file.


When ISO download is completed, you can invoke the `sha1sum` command on the ISO file
and check if checksums match.

```
[Alex@SpaceShipEL8 Downloads]$ sha1sum EL-8.3-x86_64-20210624-appstream.iso 
6a8abaaebe288553ec8568bd9de3f5fda5f1ddb5  EL-8.3-x86_64-20210624-appstream.iso
```


The second mechanism for checking ISO integrity is built-in the installer itself.
When you start the installation, use the following:

![TODO obrazek]()

After booting up, the ISO checking process will start.

### Installation with GUI

Because even minimal installation image uses GUI the whole process is simple
and straightforward. EuroLinux 8, as well as previous versions, uses Anaconda
installer that clearly informs the user what needs to be done in order to install
the system.

#### Anaconda installer **LOCALIZATION** section:

- **Keyboard** - this section allows you to setup the keyboard layouts. Including
  default keyboard layout, additionally layout and key combination to switch
  between them.
- **Language support** - additional languages packages that should be installed.
- **Time & Date** - you can configure date, time zone, enable NTP and NTP servers.

#### Anaconda installer **SOFTWARE** section:

##### Configuring source of the installatin

Here you might configure the source of your installation. By default, the system
installs from ISO image. **This is one of the officially supported ways to install
EuroLinux**. 


If you enable NIC (Network Interface Card) in the **Network**
installer section, you might add additional EuroLinux repositories and/or other
repositories. If you add EuroLinux repositories, the installer will automatically
download the newer version of the packages.

repos:

- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-BaseOS/os  
  Name: BaseOSProd
- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-AppStream/os  
  Name: AppStreamProd
- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-PowerTools/os  
  Name: PowerToolsProd

For EuroLinux beta:

- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-BaseOS/os  
  Name: BaseOSBeta
- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-AppStream/os  
  Name: AppStreamBeta
- URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-PowerTools/os  
  Name: PowerToolsBeta

!!! Warning "Limited support."
    **Network hybrid installation from ISO and public repositories is not our primary goal in the QA process**. Packages in EuroLinux repositories are regularly updated, and it might be impossible to install a system from an external source.  Depending on the state of the upstream, we might not fix potential
    issue.

Below example configuration:

![TODO](TODO)

After changing the installation source, you will have to confirm **Software
Selection**.

##### Software Selection

Software selection allows you to customize which packages will be installed.
You might choose from base environment groups like Server with GUI, Workstation
or Minimal. There is also the possibility to install additional packages groups.

#### Anaconda installer **SYSTEM** section:

- **Installation selection** allows choosing on which disk the system will be installed. If you want to have a fully encrypted system, you should enable
  encryption in this step.
- **KDUMP** allows choosing if KDUMP (Kernel crash dump collection mechanism)
  should be enabled.
- **Network & Hostname** - you can configure your system networking here
- **Security policy**  - you can setup an additional openscap policy here

#### Anaconda installer **USER SETTINGS** section:

- **Root Password** - by default, the root user is disabled. If a user is created in
  **User Creation** section, the root account could stay disabled
- **User Creation** section allows creating a regular user in the system. If the "Make this user administrator" option is checked, the root account could be disabled.


**After applying all necessary changes** installation could start with "Begin
Installation" button.


### Disk partition recommended minimums

You need at least the following partitions.

- `/boot` for Linux kernel and init ramdisks - 1GB
- `/` (root partition) - at least 10 GB (very minimal system might use as little
  as 2GB - but it requires extra attention and is not officially supported by
  EuroLinux)

For UEFI, an EFI system partition is also required.

- `/boot/efi`  - at least 100MB

If your storage allows it, the following partitions are also highly recommended:

- `swap` - 1GB or more depending on the system RAM and workload. Swap is also required for hibernation. Depending on the workload of the system, it should be at least as spacious as system RAM.
- `/home` - at least 1GB - but in most cases, if `/` can be as big as 80GB
  then `/home/` usually takes the rest of the
  free space


### installation in basic graphic mode

If there is a problem loading/running your graphic card driver (it might results in a black
screen/error message or graphic artefacts). There is the possibility to install EuroLinux
in basic graphic mode.

To do so, on the welcome menu, choose `Troubleshooting`, and then "Install in
the basic graphics mode".

From this point, the process is identical to standard installation with GUI.

### Installing EuroLinux in text mode

To install EuroLinux in the text mode:

- Boot EuroLinux ISO
- Press ++esc++ to stop installation options selection timeout
- Press ++tab++
- Add `inst.text` to the end of the kernel boot command line
- Press ++enter++

![TODO](TODO-IMAGE)

Before running the installation, you have to fill in all necessary information
(represented as `!` in selection). It's a good idea to refresh the menu with
++r+enter++ command shortly after installer start.

![TODO](TODO-IMAGE)

After customization, you are ready to start your installation.

![TODO](TODO-IMAGE)


### Other possibilities

EuroLinux can also be installed in the following manner:

- Automated installation with a kickstart file.
- Installation with PXE
- Installing via VNC

Please consult upstream documentation about these topics.

## Using EuroLinux

From this point, you can use EuroLinux as any other RHELâ„¢ based distribution.


### Submitting a Request for Change

We truly care. If there is something that you believe could/should be
changed/improved in the EuroLinux distribution and does not break compatibility
with the upstream project, then drop us the issue on GitHub! All contributors are
extremely welcome.

[EuroLinux Distro Bugs and RFC](https://github.com/EuroLinux/eurolinux-distro-bugs-and-rfc/)

### Submitting a Bug report

We decided that submitting bug reports should not involve registration into some
nasty miserable software. At the very same time, we know that most open-source developers have GitHub profiles. This choice makes the decision making and work as transparent as possible. That's why we decided to use it as the primary way to submit bugs.

[EuroLinux Distro Bugs and RFC](https://github.com/EuroLinux/eurolinux-distro-bugs-and-rfc/)

This repository allows you to stay in **direct contact** with EuroLinux
developers.
